    "\"In the statistical theory of estimation, the German tank problem involves estimating the maximum of a discrete uniform distribution from sampling without replacement. It is named from its application in World War II to the estimation of the number of German tanks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis shows the approach that was used and illustrates the difference between frequentist inference and Bayesian inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimating the population maximum based on a single sample yields divergent results, while the estimation based on multiple samples is an instructive practical estimation question whose answer is simple but not obvious.\"\n",

    "\"Panther tanks are loaded for transport to frontline units, 1943\n",
    "During the course of the war, the Western Allies made sustained efforts to determine the extent of German production and approached this in two major ways: conventional intelligence gathering and statistical estimation. In many cases, statistical analysis substantially improved on conventional intelligence. In some cases, conventional intelligence was used in conjunction with statistical methods, as was the case in estimation of Panther tank production just prior to D-Day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The allied command structure had thought the Panzer V (Panther) tanks seen in Italy, with their high velocity, long-barreled 75 mm/L70 guns, were unusual heavy tanks and would only be seen in northern France in small numbers, much the same way as the Tiger I was seen in Tunisia. The US Army was confident that the Sherman tank would continue to perform well, as it had versus the Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks in North Africa and Sicily.[N 1] Shortly before D-Day, rumors indicated that large numbers of Panzer V tanks were being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether this was true, the Allies attempted to estimate the number of tanks being produced. To do this, they used the serial numbers on captured or destroyed tanks. The principal numbers used were gearbox numbers, as these fell in two unbroken sequences. Chassis and engine numbers were also used, though their use was more complicated. Various other components were used to cross-check the analysis. Similar analyses were done on tires, which were observed to be sequentially numbered (i.e., 1, 2, 3, ..., N).[2][a][3][4]\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of tank wheels yielded an estimate for the number of wheel molds that were in use. A discussion with British road wheel makers then estimated the number of wheels that could be produced from this many molds, which yielded the number of tanks that were being produced each month. Analysis of wheels from two tanks (32 road wheels each, 64 road wheels total) yielded an estimate of 270 tanks produced in February 1944, substantially more than had previously been suspected.[5]\n",
    "\n",
    "German records after the war showed production for the month of February 1944 was 276.[6][N 2] The statistical approach proved to be far more accurate than conventional intelligence methods, and the phrase \"German tank problem\" became accepted as a descriptor for this type of statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimating production was not the only use of this serial-number analysis. It was also used to understand German production more generally, including number of factories, relative importance of factories, length of supply chain (based on lag between production and use), changes in production, and use of resources such as rubber.\""
